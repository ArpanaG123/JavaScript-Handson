//Question6.
//Whatâ€™s the difference between window vs document?

//Ans. Window object : The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy.
//It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

//Document Object : The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser.

//With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. 
//The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
